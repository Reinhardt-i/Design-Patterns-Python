# Applying Architectural Patterns to the KWIC System

## Background
The KWIC (Key Word In Context) system is a text processing application that indexes phrases to facilitate information retrieval. Given a set of input phrases, the KWIC system generates a list of circular shifts for each phrase and alphabetizes the shifts to create an index. This index allows users to search for specific keywords and quickly locate relevant phrases.

To build an efficient and maintainable KWIC system, we can apply various architectural patterns. These patterns provide proven solutions to common design challenges, ensuring a well-structured and scalable system.

## 3.1 Shared Data Pattern
- **Main Idea:** In the KWIC system, multiple components need access to the shared data, which is the collection of input phrases. The shared data pattern allows components to read and write to the shared data, ensuring synchronization and consistency.
- **Components:** Shared Data (Input Phrases), Components that read and write to the shared data (e.g., Circular Shift, Alphabetizer).
- **Context:** The shared data pattern is suitable when multiple components need access to a common data source, and synchronization and consistency are important. In the KWIC system, the shared data pattern ensures that all components operate on the same collection of input phrases.

## 3.2 Layers Pattern
- **Main Idea:** The layers pattern provides a structured and modular approach to organizing the KWIC system. It separates the functionality into different layers, each responsible for specific tasks.
- **Components:** Presentation Layer (User Interface), Business Logic Layer (KWIC Processing Logic), Data Access Layer (Shared Data Access).
- **Context:** The layers pattern is suitable for systems with complex functionality that can be logically divided into different layers. In the KWIC system, the presentation layer handles user interaction, the business logic layer processes the input phrases, and the data access layer manages access to the shared data.

## 3.3 Event-Bus Pattern
- **Main Idea:** The event-bus pattern enables decoupled communication between components in the KWIC system by using an event bus as a central communication hub. Components can publish and subscribe to events, allowing them to interact without direct dependencies.
- **Components:** Event Bus, Publishers (e.g., Circular Shift, Alphabetizer), Subscribers (e.g., User Interface).
- **Context:** The event-bus pattern is suitable when loose coupling and decoupled communication between components are desired. In the KWIC system, components like the Circular Shift and Alphabetizer can publish events indicating their completion, and the User Interface can subscribe to these events to update the display accordingly.

## 3.4 Pipe-Filter Pattern
- **Main Idea:** The pipe-filter pattern allows the KWIC system to process the input phrases through a series of filters connected by pipes. Each filter performs a specific transformation or operation on the input data.
- **Components:** Pipes (Data Channels), Filters (e.g., Circular Shift Filter, Alphabetizer Filter).
- **Context:** The pipe-filter pattern is suitable when the KWIC system requires modular and sequential processing of the input data. Each filter operates independently, and the pipes connect the filters to form a processing pipeline. In the KWIC system, the Circular Shift Filter and Alphabetizer Filter can be connected via pipes to perform the necessary transformations and generate the final index.

## Additional Considerations
- It's important to note that these patterns can be combined and adapted to meet the specific requirements of the KWIC system. For example, the Layers pattern can be used in conjunction with the Event-Bus pattern to achieve a modular and loosely coupled system.
- When applying these patterns, it's crucial to consider the trade-offs and ensure that the chosen patterns align with the desired system characteristics, such as performance, maintainability, and scalability.
- It's common to encounter misconceptions or misuse of architectural patterns. It's important to understand the principles and guidelines behind each pattern to effectively apply them in the KWIC system.
