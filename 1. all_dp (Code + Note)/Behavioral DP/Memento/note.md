Memento Pattern Overview:

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture the internal state of an object without violating encapsulation and providing the ability to restore the object to its previous state. It involves three main components: the Originator, the Memento, and the Caretaker.

- Originator: The Originator is the object that has an internal state that needs to be saved and restored. It creates a Memento object to store its internal state and can also restore its state from a Memento.

- Memento: The Memento is an object that stores the internal state of the Originator. It provides methods for retrieving the stored state and potentially modifying it, depending on the requirements of the application.

- Caretaker: The Caretaker is responsible for managing the Memento objects. It can request a Memento from the Originator to save the state and provide a Memento to the Originator to restore its state.

The Memento pattern is useful in scenarios where you need to save and restore the state of an object, such as undo/redo functionality or checkpoint systems. It promotes encapsulation by keeping the state information within the Memento object, separate from the Originator object.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Memento pattern works:

1. The Originator object (e.g., a class or an entity) creates a Memento object and passes its internal state to the Memento.

2. The Originator can also restore its internal state from a Memento object if needed.

3. The Memento object stores the internal state of the Originator without exposing it directly.

4. The Caretaker object is responsible for managing the Memento objects. It can request a Memento from the Originator to save the state and provide a Memento to the Originator to restore its state.

5. Multiple Memento objects can be kept by the Caretaker to provide a history of states or support multiple checkpoints.

The Memento pattern helps in decoupling the state management from the Originator object, allowing the Originator to focus on its primary responsibilities while providing the flexibility to save and restore states as needed.

Overall, the Memento pattern promotes flexibility, maintainability, and encapsulation by providing a way to capture and restore the internal state of an object without exposing the implementation details to external components.
