# Facade Pattern Crash Course

## What is the Facade Pattern?

The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, making it easier to use and understand. It encapsulates the complexity of the subsystem and presents a unified interface to clients.

## How to Identify the Facade Pattern?

The Facade pattern can be identified by the following characteristics:

1. The pattern involves the introduction of a facade class that serves as a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
2. The facade class encapsulates the interactions with multiple classes of the subsystem.
3. The facade class provides a unified and simplified interface that shields the client from the complexity of the subsystem.
4. The client interacts with the facade class, which internally delegates the requests to the appropriate subsystem classes.
5. The facade class does not add new functionalities but rather provides a higher-level interface to existing functionalities of the subsystem.

## When to Use the Facade Pattern?

Use the Facade pattern when:

1. You need to provide a simple and unified interface to a complex subsystem.
2. You want to encapsulate the interactions and dependencies between multiple classes of a subsystem.
3. You want to decouple the client code from the complexities of the subsystem.
4. You want to improve the readability and maintainability of the code by hiding the implementation details of the subsystem.
5. You want to provide a higher-level interface that is specific to the needs of the client.

## How to Implement the Facade Pattern?

To implement the Facade pattern, follow these steps:

1. Identify a complex subsystem that would benefit from a simplified interface.
2. Design a facade class that represents the simplified interface and encapsulates the interactions with the subsystem.
3. The facade class should delegate the client's requests to the appropriate classes of the subsystem, coordinating their interactions.
4. The client code should only interact with the facade class and remain unaware of the underlying complexities of the subsystem.
5. Ensure that the facade class does not introduce new functionalities but only provides a simplified interface to existing functionalities.

Remember, the key idea behind the Facade pattern is to provide a simplified interface that shields clients from the complexities of a subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.
