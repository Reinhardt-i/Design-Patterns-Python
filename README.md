# Design-Patterns-Python
Repo for Software Architecture and Design Pattern - (SWE-321/322)

### What is in here?

- **Assignments**
- **all dp code and notes**
- **solid principles and refactoring**
- **software architecture**
- **resourses**

Note : The codes you see as examples are taken from @CosmicBeing09 sir's [repo](https://github.com/CosmicBeing09/Design-Pattern-Demos) and converted to python. Some concepts of java don't convert well to python, but doing this has helped me a lot on the journey of learning dps. The markdown note parts are mostly ai generated, and shouldn't be used as reference. There are some funny examples, take a look if you want to. I've tried to make it more presentable. If you want to learn design patterns, consider taking a look at this repo. Thank you~
