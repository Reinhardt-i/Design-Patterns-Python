# Flyweight Pattern Crash Course

## What is the Flyweight Pattern?

The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing common data across multiple objects. It is used when the application needs to support a large number of objects with similar or identical intrinsic (invariant) state.

## How to Identify the Flyweight Pattern?

The Flyweight pattern can be identified by the following characteristics:

1. The pattern involves dividing an object into intrinsic (shared) state and extrinsic (unique) state.
2. The intrinsic state is shared and can be shared across multiple objects.
3. The extrinsic state is unique to each object and cannot be shared.
4. A flyweight factory is used to create and manage flyweight objects.
5. The flyweight factory maintains a cache or pool of shared flyweight objects.
6. Clients of the flyweight objects do not create flyweight objects directly but obtain them from the flyweight factory.

## When to Use the Flyweight Pattern?

Use the Flyweight pattern when:

1. Your application needs to support a large number of objects with similar or identical intrinsic state.
2. The objects consume significant memory, and most of their state can be made extrinsic.
3. The extrinsic state can be computed or passed in by clients, and it does not affect the shared flyweight objects.
4. The objects are immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed once created.
5. The memory usage of the application needs to be optimized.

## Intents and Components of the Flyweight Pattern:

1. Intent:
- Use sharing to support a large number of fine-grained objects efficiently.

2. Components:
- Flyweight: Represents the flyweight objects with shared intrinsic state.
- Concrete Flyweight: Implements the flyweight interface and represents the shared flyweight objects.
- Flyweight Factory: Creates and manages the flyweight objects, and provides a way to retrieve them.
- Client: Uses the flyweight objects by obtaining them from the flyweight factory.

## How to Implement the Flyweight Pattern?

To implement the Flyweight pattern, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the objects in your application and identify the intrinsic and extrinsic state.
2. Create the flyweight interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for flyweight objects.
3. Implement the concrete flyweight class(es) that represent the shared flyweight objects and implement the flyweight interface.
4. Create the flyweight factory class that manages the creation and retrieval of flyweight objects.
5. The flyweight factory should maintain a cache or pool of shared flyweight objects.
6. Ensure that the flyweight factory returns existing flyweight objects from the cache when requested by clients.
7. Clients of the flyweight objects should obtain them from the flyweight factory, rather than creating them directly.

Remember, the key idea behind the Flyweight pattern is to share common state among multiple objects to minimize memory usage and improve performance.
