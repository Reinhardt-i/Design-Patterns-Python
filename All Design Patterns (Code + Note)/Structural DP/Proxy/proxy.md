# Proxy Pattern Crash Course

## What is the Proxy Pattern?

The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object. It controls access to the underlying object and allows for additional functionality to be added before or after the main object's operations.

## How to Identify the Proxy Pattern?

The Proxy pattern can be identified by the following characteristics:

1. The pattern involves the use of an interface or abstract class that both the proxy and real object implement.
2. There is a proxy class that acts as a substitute for the real object, maintaining a reference to the real object.
3. The proxy class controls access to the real object, often by adding extra behavior or performing checks before delegating calls.
4. The proxy class follows the same interface or abstract class as the real object, allowing it to be used interchangeably.
5. The client interacts with the proxy object without being aware of the underlying delegation to the real object.

## When to Use the Proxy Pattern?

Use the Proxy pattern when:

1. You want to control access to an object, such as adding security checks or restrictions.
2. You need to delay the creation or initialization of an expensive object until it is actually needed.
3. You want to add additional behavior before or after certain operations of the real object.
4. You want to provide a simplified or restricted interface to the real object.
5. You want to cache results or provide a level of indirection to the real object.

## Intents and Components of the Proxy Pattern:

1. Intent:
- Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

2. Components:
- Subject: Defines the interface that both the proxy and real object implement.
- Real Subject: Represents the real object that the proxy class acts as a substitute for.
- Proxy: Acts as a surrogate for the real object, controlling access and adding extra behavior if needed.
- Client: Interacts with the proxy object without being aware of the underlying delegation to the real object.

## How to Implement the Proxy Pattern?

To implement the Proxy pattern, follow these steps:

1. Define an interface or abstract class that represents the common operations of the real object and the proxy.
2. Implement the real object class that provides the actual functionality.
3. Implement the proxy class that maintains a reference to the real object and controls access to it.
4. The proxy class should implement the same interface or extend the same abstract class as the real object.
5. Add any additional behavior or checks in the proxy class before or after delegating calls to the real object.
6. Clients should interact with the proxy object, which internally handles the delegation to the real object.

Remember, the key idea behind the Proxy pattern is to control access to an object and provide additional functionality without the client being aware of it.
