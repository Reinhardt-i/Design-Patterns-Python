# Decorator Pattern Crash Course

## What is the Decorator Pattern?

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows adding new behaviors or functionalities to an object dynamically without modifying its structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending the functionality of an object at runtime.

## How to Identify the Decorator Pattern?

The Decorator pattern can be identified by the following characteristics:

1. The pattern involves the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define the core functionality that can be decorated.
2. There is a base component class that implements the core functionality.
3. There are one or more decorator classes that wrap the base component and provide additional functionalities.
4. Both the base component and decorators implement the same interface or inherit from the same abstract class.
5. Decorators enhance the behavior of the base component by adding new features before or after delegating calls to the base component.

## When to Use the Decorator Pattern?

Use the Decorator pattern when:

1. You want to add behavior to an object dynamically without modifying its existing code.
2. You have a class hierarchy with multiple optional or interchangeable functionalities, and you want to combine them flexibly.
3. You need to add or remove functionalities from an object at runtime.
4. You want to avoid using subclassing to extend the functionality of objects, as it may result in a large number of subclasses.

## How to Implement the Decorator Pattern?

To implement the Decorator pattern, follow these steps:

1. Define an interface or an abstract class that represents the core functionality to be decorated.
2. Create a concrete component class that implements the core functionality.
3. Define an abstract decorator class that implements the same interface or inherits from the same abstract class as the component.
4. Include a reference to the component in the decorator class.
5. Implement one or more concrete decorator classes by extending the decorator class and adding additional functionalities.
6. Decorators can add behavior before or after calling the component's methods.
7. To use the decorators, create an instance of the component and wrap it with one or more decorators.
8. Use the decorated object, which will have the combined functionalities of the component and decorators.

Remember, the key idea behind the Decorator pattern is to wrap objects with decorators dynamically to add new behaviors or functionalities without modifying their structure.
