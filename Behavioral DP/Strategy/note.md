# Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by selecting from a set of interchangeable algorithms. It provides a way to encapsulate different algorithms and make them interchangeable within a single interface.

## Problem

In software development, there are scenarios where we need to implement different variations of an algorithm or behavior. For example, consider a sorting algorithm that needs to support multiple sorting strategies such as bubble sort, quick sort, or merge sort. 

One naive approach is to implement each variation of the algorithm as a separate method or function, and then conditionally select the appropriate one at runtime using conditional statements or switches. However, this approach leads to code duplication and violates the principle of **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Solution

The Strategy pattern suggests encapsulating each variation of the algorithm into separate classes that implement a common interface or base class. This interface defines a method that represents the algorithm. The client code can then select and use the desired algorithm dynamically, without being aware of the implementation details.

## Structure

The main components of the Strategy pattern are:

- **Context**: It represents the context or the object that needs to change its behavior dynamically. The context maintains a reference to the current strategy object and delegates the execution of the algorithm to the strategy object.

- **Strategy**: It is an interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for all concrete strategies. It represents the algorithm or behavior that can be used by the context.

- **Concrete Strategies**: These are the implementation classes that provide different variations of the algorithm. Each concrete strategy implements the strategy interface and provides its own implementation for the algorithm.

## Example

Let's consider an example of sorting algorithms. We have a `Sorter` class that needs to support different sorting strategies such as bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort. We can apply the Strategy pattern to implement this scenario.

1. Define the `SortingStrategy` interface or base class that declares a method for sorting.

2. Implement concrete strategies by creating classes such as `BubbleSortStrategy`, `QuickSortStrategy`, and `MergeSortStrategy`, which implement the `SortingStrategy` interface.

3. Create the `Sorter` class that maintains a reference to the current strategy object and delegates the sorting operation to the strategy object.

4. The client code creates an instance of the `Sorter` class and sets the desired sorting strategy dynamically at runtime.

5. Finally, the client code calls the `sort()` method on the `Sorter` object, which performs the sorting using the selected strategy.

By using the Strategy pattern, we achieve a flexible and maintainable solution where we can easily add new sorting strategies without modifying the existing code.

## Benefits

The Strategy pattern offers several benefits, including:

- **Flexibility**: It allows for easy addition and swapping of strategies at runtime without modifying the context or client code.

- **Separation of Concerns**: It promotes the separation of the algorithm implementation from the context, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

- **Code Reusability**: Each strategy can be reused independently in different contexts or applications.

- **Improved Testability**: Each strategy can be tested independently, which simplifies the testing process.

## Conclusion

The Strategy pattern provides a clean and extensible way to handle variations of an algorithm or behavior in a software system. By encapsulating the variations into separate classes, we can easily switch between different strategies at runtime without modifying the existing code. This promotes code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability in our applications.

By understanding and applying the Strategy pattern, we can design more flexible and modular software systems that can adapt to changing requirements and support different variations of algorithms or behaviors with ease.
