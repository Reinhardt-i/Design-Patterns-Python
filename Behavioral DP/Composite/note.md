## Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The pattern lets clients treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly through a common interface.

### Key Components

1. **Component**: This is the base interface or abstract class that represents both individual objects and compositions of objects. It declares the common operations that can be performed on both types of objects.

2. **Leaf**: This represents the individual objects in the composition. It implements the operations defined in the Component interface. A leaf has no children.

3. **Composite**: This represents the compositions of objects. It contains child components and implements the operations defined in the Component interface. It can perform operations on its child components by delegating the calls to them.

4. **Client**: This is the class that interacts with the Component interface to manipulate the objects in the composition. The client treats individual objects and compositions uniformly through the Component interface.

### Usage

The Composite pattern is suitable when you have a part-whole hierarchy and want to treat individual objects and groups of objects in a uniform manner. It is useful in situations where the client code needs to work with objects that can be either leaf objects or compositions of objects.

The pattern provides the following benefits:

- It simplifies the client code by allowing it to treat both individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- It enables the creation of complex tree-like structures of objects.
- It provides flexibility in adding new types of objects to the composition without affecting the client code.

### Example Explanation

In the provided example, the Composite pattern is used to represent a file system hierarchy consisting of files and directories.

- The `FileSystemComponent` interface serves as the Component base interface, defining the common `display_details()` method for both files and directories.

- The `File` class represents a leaf object, implementing the `display_details()` method to display details specific to a file.

- The `Directory` class represents a composite object, implementing the `display_details()` method to display details of the directory and its contents recursively. It can contain multiple `FileSystemComponent` objects, acting as both leaf and composite objects.

- The `Client` class interacts with the file system components through the `FileSystemComponent` interface. It creates instances of files and directories, adds components to directories, and calls the `display_details()` method on the root directory to display the entire file system's details.

By using the Composite pattern, the code can handle files and directories uniformly, allowing for easy creation and traversal of complex file system structures.

Remember, the Composite pattern enables you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, providing a convenient way to work with hierarchical structures.
