State Pattern Overview

The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates different behaviors into separate state classes and enables the object to dynamically switch between these states at runtime.

Participants

The State pattern involves the following participants:

- Context: Represents the object that can have different internal states. It maintains a reference to the current state object and delegates state-specific behavior to that object.
- State: Defines an interface or an abstract base class for the state objects. It declares methods that represent the state-specific behavior.
- Concrete States: Implements the behavior associated with a particular state. Each concrete state provides its own implementation of the state-specific behavior.

Benefits of Using the State Pattern

- Simplifies the code by separating the behavior associated with each state into its own class.
- Allows new states to be added easily by implementing a new concrete state class.
- Enables the object to change its behavior dynamically at runtime by switching to a different state.

Usage Examples

- Handling different states of an order fulfillment process (e.g., ordered, shipped, delivered).
- Implementing a state machine for a game character with different states (e.g., idle, walking, jumping).
- Managing different states of a document editor (e.g., editing, saving, printing).
