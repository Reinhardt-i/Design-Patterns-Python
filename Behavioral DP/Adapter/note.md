# Crash Course: Adapter Pattern

## Overview
The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to collaborate without modifying their existing code.

## Key Components
1. **Target:** Defines the interface that the client uses to interact with the desired objects.
2. **Adaptee:** Represents the existing class or component that needs to be adapted to work with the client code.
3. **Adapter:** Implements the Target interface and adapts the Adaptee's interface to match the Target's expected interface. It acts as a wrapper around the Adaptee, translating requests from the client into calls to the Adaptee.

## Implementation Steps
1. Identify the incompatible interfaces between the client and the existing class or component (Adaptee).
2. Create the Target interface that the client code expects.
3. Implement the Adapter class, which acts as an intermediary between the client and the Adaptee.
4. The Adapter class implements the Target interface and internally holds an instance of the Adaptee.
5. In the Adapter class, map the calls from the Target interface methods to the appropriate methods or functionality of the Adaptee.
6. The client code interacts with the Target interface, and the Adapter handles the communication and translates requests to the Adaptee.

## Benefits of the Adapter Pattern
- Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- Enables the reuse of existing classes or components that wouldn't be compatible with the client otherwise.
- Provides a flexible way to introduce new functionality without modifying existing code.
- Promotes the principle of separation of concerns and modularity by keeping the client code isolated from the specific implementation details of the Adaptee.

## Examples of Use
- Converting between different data formats (e.g., JSON to XML, CSV to JSON).
- Wrapping a legacy system with a modern interface.
- Adapting third-party libraries or components to fit with the client's requirements.
- Making disparate classes or systems work together seamlessly.

Remember, the Adapter pattern allows you to bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces, enabling code reuse, flexibility, and maintaining the principle of separation of concerns.
