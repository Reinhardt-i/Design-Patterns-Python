## Builder Pattern

The **Builder pattern** is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of an object from its representation. It provides a way to construct complex objects step by step, allowing the construction process to vary independently from the object's structure.

### Main Idea

The main idea behind the Builder pattern is to encapsulate the construction logic of an object within a separate builder class. Instead of directly instantiating the object and setting its properties, the client code interacts with the builder to configure and construct the object.

### Key Components

- **Product**: Represents the complex object being built.
- **Builder**: Provides an interface for configuring and constructing the product.
- **Concrete Builder**: Implements the builder interface and provides the necessary operations to construct the product.
- **Director**: Controls the construction process using the builder object.

### Advantages of Builder Pattern

- Allows the creation of complex objects with step-by-step construction.
- Provides a clear and readable way to configure and construct objects with different combinations of properties.
- Encapsulates the construction logic, making it easier to manage and modify.
- Provides control over the construction process, enabling the creation of consistent objects.

### Example

Consider an example of building a `Pizza` object using the Builder pattern. The `Pizza` class represents a pizza with various toppings, and the `PizzaBuilder` class handles the construction process.

The client code interacts with the `PizzaBuilder` by calling methods to add toppings and configure the pizza. Once the pizza is fully configured, the client invokes the `build` method to obtain the final `Pizza` object.

```python
class Pizza:
# Represents the complex object being built
# ...


class PizzaBuilder:
# Provides methods to configure and construct the pizza
# ...

# Client code
builder = PizzaBuilder()
builder.add_topping("cheese")
builder.add_topping("pepperoni")
builder.set_size("large")
pizza = builder.build()

```

In this example, the Builder pattern allows us to create different variations of Pizza objects by selectively adding toppings and configuring properties. The construction process is separated from the client code, providing a flexible and readable way to construct complex objects.

By using the Builder pattern, we can easily extend the pizza construction process, add new features, and ensure consistent object creation throughout the application.

I hope this explanation provides a clear understanding of the Builder pattern without including specific code examples.
