# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## When to use it?

Use the Singleton pattern when you need to ensure that only one instance of a class is created throughout the program and you want to provide a global access point to that instance.

## How does it work?

The Singleton pattern involves the following elements:

1. Private constructor: The class with the Singleton pattern has a private constructor, preventing direct instantiation of the class from external code.

2. Private instance variable: The class contains a private static variable that holds the single instance of the class.

3. Static creation method: The class provides a static method to create and access the single instance. This method checks if an instance already exists and either returns the existing instance or creates a new one.

## Benefits of Singleton Pattern

- Provides a single point of access to the instance.
- Avoids the need for global variables.
- Allows lazy initialization of the instance, creating it only when needed.

## Considerations

- Be cautious of using Singleton excessively as it may introduce tight coupling and make the code harder to test.
- Ensure thread safety if the Singleton will be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

The Singleton pattern offers a simple way to ensure that only one instance of a class exists, providing global access and centralized control over that instance.
