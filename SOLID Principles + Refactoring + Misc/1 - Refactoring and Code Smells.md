# Refactoring Code Smells

## Inappropriate Naming

Code that has poor or misleading names can be difficult to understand and maintain. It is important to use clear and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes to enhance code readability.

## Comments

Excessive or outdated comments can clutter the code and make it harder to understand. It is best to use comments sparingly and focus on writing self-explanatory code that does not require extensive commenting.

## Dead Code

Dead code refers to code that is no longer used and serves no purpose. It should be identified and removed from the codebase to improve clarity and avoid confusion.

## Duplicated Code

Code duplication leads to maintenance issues and increases the risk of introducing bugs. It is advisable to refactor duplicated code into reusable functions or classes to promote code reuse and maintainability.

## Primitive Obsession

Using primitive types excessively instead of creating appropriate domain-specific objects can result in complex and error-prone code. It is recommended to encapsulate related data and behavior within classes to improve code organization and clarity.

## Large Class

Classes that are overly large and handle multiple responsibilities can become difficult to understand and maintain. It is beneficial to split large classes into smaller, more focused classes to improve cohesion and readability.

## Lazy Class

Lazy classes are classes that do not contribute much value and can be eliminated. If a class does not have a clear purpose or functionality, it is better to remove it from the codebase.

## Alternative Class with Different Interface

Having multiple classes that provide similar functionality but with different interfaces can lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity. It is preferable to consolidate these classes and ensure consistent interfaces.

## Long Method

Long methods are hard to comprehend and maintain. It is recommended to break down long methods into smaller, more focused methods to improve readability and understandability.

## Long Parameter List

Methods with a long list of parameters can be challenging to use and understand. Consider refactoring such methods by encapsulating related parameters within objects or using parameter objects to simplify the method signature.

## Switch Statements

Switch statements can lead to code that is difficult to extend and maintain, especially when new cases need to be added. Consider using polymorphism or the Strategy pattern to eliminate switch statements and improve code flexibility.

## Speculative Generality

Writing code that anticipates future requirements but is not currently needed leads to unnecessary complexity and bloat. Avoid speculative generality and refactor code to be more focused on current requirements.

## Oddball Solution

Implementing an unusual or unconventional solution to a problem can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is advisable to follow established coding conventions and patterns to ensure code consistency and ease of comprehension.

## Feature Envy

When a method excessively relies on data from another class, it indicates a feature envy smell. Consider moving the method to the class that holds the data to improve cohesion and encapsulation.

## Refused Bequest

Refused bequest occurs when a subclass does not use or overrides most of the methods inherited from its parent class. It is better to eliminate or modify the unnecessary inheritance relationship to improve code clarity.

## Black Sheep

Black sheep refers to a class or component that does not adhere to the overall design and stands out as an outlier. It is advisable to bring the black sheep in line with the design principles to maintain consistency.

## Train Wreck

A train wreck occurs when there is a long sequence of method calls on a single object, making the code hard to read and understand. Refactor the code by introducing intermediate variables or breaking down the method calls to improve clarity.

# Refactoring vs Patterns

Refactoring and patterns are both valuable techniques for improving code quality and maintainability, but they serve different purposes.
QUOTE IN THE PDFFFF!!!

## Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It focuses on improving code quality, readability, and maintainability by eliminating code smells and improving design. Refactoring is typically applied at the code level and aims to enhance the internal structure of the codebase.

When to Refactor:
- When code smells are identified, such as duplicated code, long methods, or inappropriate naming.
- When adding new features or making modifications to existing code to ensure it remains clean and manageable.
- When collaborating with a team to align coding standards and conventions.
- When striving to improve code readability, maintainability, and testability.

How to Refactor:
- Identify code smells or areas that need improvement.
- Plan the refactoring approach and determine the desired outcome.
- Make small, incremental changes to the code while preserving functionality.
- Continuously test the code to ensure the desired behavior is maintained.
- Refactor iteratively, focusing on one area at a time.

## Patterns

Patterns, specifically architectural patterns, provide high-level solutions to recurring design problems in software systems. They define the overall structure, organization, and relationships between components to achieve specific quality attributes and design goals. Patterns are typically applied at the system or module level and guide the overall architecture of the software.

When to Use Patterns:
- When designing or refactoring the overall structure of a system to address specific design goals or quality attributes.
- When facing recurring design problems for which established solutions exist.
- When collaborating with a team to establish common architectural guidelines.
- When striving to achieve modularity, scalability, maintainability, or other system-level qualities.

How to Use Patterns:
- Understand the problem context and identify the design goals and constraints.
- Select an appropriate architectural pattern that matches the requirements.
- Apply the pattern by defining the components, connectors, and interactions.
- Tailor the pattern to fit the specific needs of the system.
- Continuously evaluate and refine the architectural design based on feedback and evolving requirements.
